# Algorithms
This repo will have some algorithms based on different solutions and approaches.
Project Structure is simple > Algorithm name > participant > files.

## Exercise 1 - Binary and lineal search
Do 2 different algorithms using lineal and binary search method.
Input: Array size (integer)
Output: Spent time in each algorithm.
Rules: The array only will have integers.
## Exercise 2 - Three
The staircase is right-aligned, composed of # symbols and spaces, staircase height will be based on the number captured.
Input: Staircase size (integer)
Output: Staircase right aligned.
Rules: The array will be aligned to the right (like the example), the number of steps will be dictated by the input number.

Example, Input number = 6

## Exercise 3 - Matrix Sum
You will generate a matrix with random numbers from 1 to 999999, you need to reverse its rows and columns any number of times and the goal is to maximize the
sum of the elements in the n x n sub-matrix located in the upper-left corner of the 2n x 2n matrix (upper left quadrant).
Input: Matrix size (Two integer numbers, rows and columns, this numbers must be greater than 3).
Output: Integer with the maximum value possible in the sub-matrix.
Rules: The array will be aligned to the right (like the example), the number of steps will be dictated by the input number.
